  /// Paths can be either relative (leading '/'), absolute (non-empty,
  /// not leading '/'), or empty. An empty path is a degenerate case
  /// that arises because we need the default constructor Path() to take
  /// on a well-defined value. Concatenation with empty paths yields
  /// whichever argument is non-empty. The car() and cdr() operations on
  /// empty paths return empty paths. File system operations on empty
  /// paths throw exceptions.
  ///
  /// Eventually, opencm will handle paths as UTF-8 strings, but for now
  /// we only handle 127 bit ascii encoded in 8 bit characters. Some
  /// European users have noted that this is a pain in the neck for
  /// them, but until I understand the filesystem compatibility issues
  /// better I don't want to dive in on solving this.
  ///
  /// Update: The issue with UTF-8 isn't strictly a problem with the
  /// Path class. It's a problem of interacting successfully with the
  /// filesystem interface on filesystems that do not support unicode
  /// file names. It's a client portability issue rather than a
  /// functional issue, and we probably need to consider making this a
  /// configurable thing rather than penalizing the Europeans. Linux
  /// EXT[23] at this point handle UTF-8 filenames just fine. I need to
  /// get a status update on Win32.
