# NOTE: RPM really wasn't designed for cross builds.
#
# We don't want to use --target, because the output binaries
# are supposed to get installed on the build host. Therefore,
# I am exploiting a macro hack. This RPM is designed to be run
# with a command line like:
#
#    rpmbuild --define "crossarch i386"
#
# If the define is not provided, the build will default to
# target i386.
#
# NOTE: Building this requires that a suitable pre-gcc has 
# been installed in the target build environment! The current
# build process relies on this being done BY HAND
